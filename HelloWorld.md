### Professional Statements

I am Ben Savage, a former **Live Events Technician** moving into the world of Cybersecurity - focusing on Network Analysis and Memory Forensics; from conducting my own lab tests to analysing exisiting samples from online sources. From the world of Live Events, I have brought my exisiting networking knowledge and applied it into new areas of the IT World - working with tools such as **WireShark, Scapy, Snort** and **more** to improve my knowledge and test new ideas. I also frequently stay up to date with the latest in Cybersecurity news while also completing CTF's and Labs online. 

Recently, I have been performing **Network Analysis** using **Wirehsark and Scapy** to look at exisiting malicious pcap files that have been submitted online for practice while also researching the ways in which an attack on a network might be commited from a Red Team perspective.

While also completing my labs and research, I am currently in the process of revising and studying for the <code>Certified Information Systems Security Professional Certification</code> and also the <code>GIAC Intrusion Analyst Certification.</code>

### Professional Statements

I am Ben Savage, a former **Live Events Technician** moving into the world of Cybersecurity - focusing on Network Analysis and Memory Forensics; from conducting my own lab tests to analysing exisiting samples from online sources. From the world of Live Events, I have brought my exisiting networking knowledge and applied it into new areas of the IT World - working with tools such as **WireShark, Scapy, Snort** and **more** to improve my knowledge and test new ideas. I also frequently stay up to date with the latest in Cybersecurity news while also completing CTF's and Labs online. 

Recently, I have been performing **Network Analysis** using **Wirehsark and Scapy** to look at exisiting malicious pcap files that have been submitted online for practice while also researching the ways in which an attack on a network might be commited from a Red Team perspective. I bring professionalism, a unique approach to challanges and 

While also completing my labs and research, I am currently in the process of revising and studying for the <code>Certified Information Systems Security Professional Certification</code> and also the <code>GIAC Intrusion Analyst Certification.</code>

### Labs 

Listed below are some of the highlighted projects/labs I have completed as part of my Cybersecurity Portfolio - ranging from Network Analysis to real-world investigations into emerging technqiues that are being used in the world of Cybersecurity.

#### 1. Network Analysis with Wireshark

In this project, I use **Wireshark** to analyse existing PCAP files to look at normal and malicous traffic behaviour to differentiate and find IOC's through these PCAP's. These include looking at the <code>TCP and UDP Protocols </code> , <code> HTTP Requests and Posts </code> , <code> IPv4 and ARP Traffic </code> and more. This project looks at a range of PCAP files such as DOS attacks, Malware Analysis, Scanning via nmap and more.

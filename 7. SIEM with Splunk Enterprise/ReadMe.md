## Overview

This project is a practical look into using a Security Information and Event Management solution (SIEM). For this project I am going to be using Splunk Enterprise, a Cisco company who offer a free trial to their SIEM solution - I will be setting up my lab laptop as a host for Splunk as well as adding the Splunk agent to my lab laptop to be able to trigger security events to pick up in the SIEM. Being able to use an SIEM solution is very important as this is where information can be gathered as part of an investigation and look at specific pieces of data as part of a large data set.

# 8. Investigation into Emerging Techniques in Cybersecurity

## Overview

This blog looks at recent news stories and cybersecurity blogs to look into the emerging techniques and attacks that are coming through in Cybersecurity - as part of my portfolio this is an important part of my personal development as keeping up to date with the latest trends and latest stories in cybersecurity to learn what the latest threats are and what might be considered a risk as part of an associations infastructure. There are many resources online from trusted news outlets to security professionals who blg about recent events. In my belief, as technology grows at the rate it is, the scope of cybersecurity will change with it at the same rate - as we get more devices such as IoT devices for smarthomes and new vunerabilities get found, being able to stay on top of the curve and identify new trends is important. I will be aiming to complete a new blog once every 1/2 weeks.

News Story: UK underestimates threat of cyber-attacks from hostile states and gangs, says security chief - by Dan Milmo

I've chose to look at this news piece uploaded on the 3rd of December as from the headline it looks like an interesting story on the landscape of cybersecurity in the UK and where the country is currently at in terms of defence. The statements comes from the head of the GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (Richard Horne) - expressing his concerns at the state of cyber attacks the UK is getting from foreign states such as Russia and China. 

In this news article, Horne basically explains how attacks from these foreign states are becoming "more complex and have increased in frequency" over the last year. He also says that the UK as a whole is underestimating the scale of what is being faced. From a personal point have view, it has always been expressed how foreign states are trying to infiltrate UK systems and how the UK has responded to these suspected attacks. For example, at the current company I work for, the use of Hikvision cameras (manufactured in China) is prohibited from the main network and any sub-networks, however from visiting other locations such as venues and shopping centres, the use of these Hikvision cameras is being utilised everywhere. Looking at a security blog from CCTV Security Pro's, they even say the Hikvision IP cameras **are not** NDAA Compliant while also having known security vulnerabilities from research - yet it is still being used by medium - large buisnesses as a use case. More on the Hikvision camera blog here: https://www.cctvsecuritypros.com/blog/the-risks-of-dahua-hikvision-nonndaa-approved-security-cameras/

Anyways back to the main topic of discussion, the report then goes on to say that recent ransomware attacks from these adveseries attacked some high profile targets including a company who deal with blood tests for the NHS Trusts and GP Services. For me as someone entering the world of Cybersecurity, one of the things I have always been taught from the Live Event industry is to test, test and test your systems to make sure they are working as expected. Now obviously as these attacks change and attackers try and avoid firewalls and IDS/IPS's - being able to test rules and hardware is an important part of staying up to date with the latest attacks and threats. From my view - knowing every trick an attacker might try and pull like obfuscation and malicious fragmentation are easy to identify - but when a new threat comes in with a unique way of getting past said systems - being able to identify the technique they have employed and making it well known to others and systems make it easier to stop threats. Now I know this isn't available all the time due to external reasons - but even having the knowledge of how malware has been developed or what it is made up of can help identify flags that could be used by systems. It is why I have chose a liking to investigating malware samples in a sandbox environment - even at an entry-level being able to see what malware looks like in its most basic form and what it is actually doing in a system gives a better understanding of what an attacker is trying to get out of it.

What really suprised me however in this report was near the end where it has been highlighted in the past couple of months that North Korea workers have been disguising themselves as Freelance 3rd-Country IT Staff and working within UK Firms. A story about this broke out in November of 2024 where it was reported that large firms were employing these freelance staff. Story: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-it-workers/ . It goes back to my first training I undertook in my cybersecurity adventure - **humans are the weakest point** - from phishing campaigns to social engineering humans are more likely to click a suspicious link and grant access to an attack vector. It is why user teaching and learning of IT Security is so important in the case of a company because an attacker would rather send a mass phishing campaign with a click rate rather than try to infiltrate a system which takes more time with enumeration etc. With this part of the story for me it basically makes me wonder how these incidents do happen - are security systems and protocols too weak or are attackers getting more clever in the way they gain access. For these foreign actors - information and data is a weapon that can be used in other circumstances outside of the world of IT - which in turn has an affect on human lives.

As a whole the article gives a good indication of the state of UK Cybersecurity and why it is so important in this modern world we live in where we rely on technology in every part of our life - from payments to healthcare it is in every part of life and becoming more common to move what would usually be done manually to a form of technology, which in my opinion adds another possible vulnerability to anyone.

## Overview

This project looks at Snort, an Open Soruce Intrusion Detection and Prevention System used in personal and buisness cases for identifying network intrusions. This project looks at the Snort program and installing the software and configuring the snort.config file to be able to work on the network. This project also looks at using Snort to be able to make rules and alerts using Snort and applying them to a closed-lab scenario with also using Scapy to be able to test the alerts. Furthermore - I will also be looking at the rule making structure for Snort and how it can be used for multiple scenarios and use cases.

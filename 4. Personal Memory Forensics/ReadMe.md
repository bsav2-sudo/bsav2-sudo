## Overview

This project looks at doing Memory Forensics - specifically for Windows Systems utilising different tools to find out infomation about a certain machine. This is useful in a scenario where a machine has been compromised and needs to be investigated to find behaviour that led to the machine being compromised. This is a useful skill to have in the world of Cybersecurity as it will allow for reporting on incidents more clear and accurate from generating information from said compromised machines. Furthermore - being able to use tools such as Eric Zimmerman tools and Registry Editor for me allows me to understand what is happening at a machine level with Network Interactions, User Behaviour and unique characteristics - which in future can prevent attacks leading to compromised machines being detected and irradicated more efficiently.

For this project I will be using my lab machine as the "compromised" machine - this machine has not been compromised in any way however will evidence a proof of concept of being able to collect information from an infected machine. So lets get started!

## Generating Evidence

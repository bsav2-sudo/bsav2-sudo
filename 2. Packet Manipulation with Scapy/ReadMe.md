## Overview

This project looks at Scapy, a Python library used for packet manipulation and testing networks with specially crafted packets. In this project, I am going to be exploring Scapy including how to craft packets with TCP, IP and Ether as well as sending packets over the network (with looking at these packets in Wireshark for proof of concept). Scapy can also be used for Packet Sniffing on a network to be bale to look at packets sent over the network, but for this project I will be mainly focusing on the packet crafting section of Scapy. So lets get started.

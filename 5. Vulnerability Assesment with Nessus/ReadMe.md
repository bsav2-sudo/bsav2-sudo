## Overview

In this project - I will be using Tenable's Nessus and NMap to conduct as Vulnerability Assesment on my home network to discover where there are vulnerabilites in the network and also in endpoints. The aim of the project is to be able to complete a vulnerability assesment while creating a plan to address the vulnerabilities found in terms of risk. This project will focus on the Network and Host-Based Vulnerabilities however in future projects I hope to expand to Wireless vulnerabilities and more. So without further ado lets get started.

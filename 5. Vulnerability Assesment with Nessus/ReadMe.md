## Overview

In this project - I will be using Tenable's Nessus and NMap to conduct as Vulnerability Assesment on my home network to discover where there are vulnerabilites in the network and also in endpoints. The aim of the project is to be able to complete a vulnerability assesment while creating a plan to address the vulnerabilities found in terms of risk. This project will focus on the Network and Host-Based Vulnerabilities however in future projects I hope to expand to Wireless vulnerabilities and more. So without further ado lets get started. 

## Nmap

One of my favourite tools for being able to perform network scanning is of course Nmap. Nmap is an open source utility used for doing network discovery and security auditing - it is one of the most used tools within the realm of Cybersecurity as it is easy to use and can be powerful when used correctly. In this project being able to use Nmap to discover hosts on my home network and also do other things such as OS detection and open ports of these hosts. So the first thing I'm going to do is run a scan using Nmap on my network.

One notable to mention is that in this project I'm going to be using Zenmap which is a GUI version of Nmpa - I prefer to use the GUI version as I find it easier to use and easier to define the parameters I want to set for the scan.

For this scan there are a few parameters I want to set to be able to get the best results from the scan as possible which are:

- Fragment the scan over a longer period of time - this will try to get passed some of the firewall features and rules
- Intense scan of the network - get as many open ports as it can find
- Be as silent as possible on the network so that the Firewall doesn't suspect a scan is taking place

To do this I am going to use the following command for Nmap:

<code>nmap -T4 -A -v -Pn 192.168.1.0/24</code> - Also known in Zenmap as Intense Scan, No Ping Profile

This will do the following:

- T4 - Agressive Time Template
- A - Enables OS Detection
- v - Verbose
- Pn - Disable Host Discovery

This will allow me to do a very sneaky scan on the network without gaining too much attention, so without further ado let's run it!

As you can see the scan is running and looking for all the open ports on the network while also doing OS detection.

And after around 15 mins the results are in...

> In total 11 hosts were detected at the time of the scan including TV's, IOT devices and Laptops/PC's

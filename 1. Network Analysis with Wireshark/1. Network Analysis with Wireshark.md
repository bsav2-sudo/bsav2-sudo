## Overview

This project looks at **3** PCAP files obtained from the Wireshark Wiki page. The project demonstrates the understanding of utilising Wireshark and also being able to identify malicious traffic from PCAP files, ranging from small PCAP files to large captured files that have been collated over a number of dates. These PCAP files emulate the scenarios in which Network forensics may be required as evidence as part of an investigation, these range from a vulnerablity being exploited to an emulated recconaisance on a target which is seen in the real world. The ability to be able to identify these as part of a Cybersecurity role is very important, as it can help make firewall and IDS rules that can stop attacks from happening and also be able to determine malicious traffic from normal user traffic.

## PCAP Analysis 

### 11-DAYS-OF-SCAN

Context: This file contains traffic information which is collated over 11 Days - **Suspected Scanning From External Host**
File Size: 29.1 MB
File Name: 2024-08-30-approximately-11-days-of-server-scans-and-probes.pcap
File Type: .pcap
Timeframe: 19/08/2024 to 30/08/2024

#### Start of Analysis

To start this analysis - the first step I took was to find out all the details of the pcap file from the "Statistics" page which is found in <code>Statistics -> Capture File Properties</code>. This allows me to be able to get a brief overview of the PCAP file to identify what type of packet capture it is. The questions I ask myself is, is it a large or small file?  How long was the packet capture taken for? What is the timeframe for this? How many packets were recieved over this time period? 

All of this is answered in the <code>Capture File Properties</code> which is shown below:

![Stats](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/032a11c9-5348-4c79-b96f-0ca4c99c42b0)

From these statistics there are some things that become very apparent before even touching any of the packets. 

Firstly, this is a very large capture file that has been taken over a long period of time. This defines the approach that I can take towards the packet file, as it is such a long time frame I am going to be looking for network patterns over a long period as we know from the information of the file that I am looking for a suspected scan on a host. 

Secondly, I know that I will need to gain some more information from the file before going into the actual analysis of packets etc. Looking for what protocols are being used heavily is a very good way for me to see what traffic this server is experiencing. So now to do this I will look at <code>Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy</code>. 

The hierarchy will give an overview of all the protocols used in this pcap file to see which is the most dominant protocol. Looking at the <code>Protocol Hierarchy</code> this is the result:

![Protocol Hierarchy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d0b3395-1f87-4d4f-8577-4cac3d5733ad)

As I can see from the Hierarchy; TCP (Transport Control Protocol) is 94.1% of the total packets in this .pcap file, which is somewhat expected as I am dealing with a servers network capture but gives clarification to the fact that I should be keeping in mind that the suspected scanning could be a TCP style scan - as the scan could be underlying within the usual TCP traffic. A small note I have also made is I am dealing with the IPv4 protocol and there is no IPv6 packets which helps me narrow down what I should be looking for. 

It is very interesting to note that the ICMP makes up 4.1% of the packets in the .pcap file.  This may be to allow local network admins to be able to see if the server is up or down by doing simple ping tests or sending other ICMP messages. This could be something that can be part of the investigation to see if there is any suspicious ICMP messages being sent to the server.

Now that I have slightly filtered what I should expect to be looking for in this, there is one last step I want to undertake before looking at the file in full is the <code>Endpoints</code> and <code>Conversations</code> that are taking place in this file which is listed below:

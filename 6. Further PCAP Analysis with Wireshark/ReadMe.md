## Overview

This project looks at **3** more PCAP files that I have sourced from the internet to further explore Network Traffic analysis on different attacks. This project looks at ARP Storms, IPv4 Fragmentation and also analysis of 802.11 protocol to see how it works within Wireshark. The PCAP files have been sourced from trusted websites who provide practice .pcap files to be able to practice and identify network traffic. I wanted to explore more of the practice PCAP files to be able to further my ability and being able to identify types of network attacks. I am particularly interested in the analysis of the 802.11 protocol - as for most of my learning - I have been looking at Ethernet protocols, but wireless networks are prone to attacks as well including de-authentication attacks and more. SO lets get started by looking at an ARP Storm attack.

## PCAP Analysis 

## ARP-STORM
